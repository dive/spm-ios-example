# Summary

This is an example project for my attempts to build an iOS framework with Swift Package Manager, and re-use it in the real iOS application. It works. Mostly. But due to some restrictions and limitations, it's almost impossible to use it in the real-life environment.
The whole solution is based on `.xcconfig` usage and some additional options for `swiftc`. The real story behind this repository is explained in the ["Swift Package Manager builds iOS frameworks :nope:"](https://dive.github.io/swift-package-manager/ios/2019/01/20/swift_package_manager_vs_ios.html) article.
